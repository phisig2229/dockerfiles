dockerfiles
===========

A place to store all my dockerfiles


NOTE - None of these are working currently.  Dockerfiles for building Java images are not working (busybox does not support a version of wget that can use cookies, which is needed to pull down java packages from Oracle).. Working to get them updated to something that will work correctly.
